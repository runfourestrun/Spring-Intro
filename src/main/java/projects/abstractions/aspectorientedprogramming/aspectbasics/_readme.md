* An aspect is simply a piece of logic the framework executes when you call specific methods of your choice. When designing an aspect, you define the following:

* What code you want Spring to execute when you call specific methods. This is named an ***aspect***.

* When the app should execute this logic of the aspect (e.g., before or after the method call, instead of the method call). This is named the **advice**.

* Which methods the framework needs to intercept and execute the aspect for them. This is named a **pointcut**.
