## Coupled vs Decoupled with abstraction



* The classes in the package are heavily coupled, if you want to change the sorting responsiblity you also
* need to change the object using the responsibility
* The design problem occurs because the DeliveryDetailsPrinter object specifys both what it needs and how it needs it
